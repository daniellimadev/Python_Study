# Variables are used to save something in the computer's memory.
# PEP8: start variables with lowercase letters, you can use
# numbers and underscore _.
# The = sign is the assignment operator. It is used to
# assign a value to a name (variable).
# Usage: variable_name = expression

# full_name = 'Daniel Pereira De lima'
# sum_two_plus_two = 2 + 2
# int_um = bool('1')
# print(int_one, type(int_one))
# print(full_name, sum_two_plus_two)
